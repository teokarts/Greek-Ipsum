# Greek Placeholder Text Generator

This project provides a responsive web page using HTML and Tailwind CSS, designed to generate and display Greek placeholder text. It mimics the functionality of "Lorem Ipsum" generators, but with content derived from Greek fairy tales, myths, and other creative placeholder stories. Users can copy text snippets or lists with ease using the interactive copy buttons provided.

It's a little bit similar to [Website ipsum](https://websiteipsum.com/index.html)
